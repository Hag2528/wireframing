What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is a visual representation or blueprint of a user interface (UI). It outlines the basic structure and layout of a digital product—such as a website or mobile app—without focusing on colors, graphics, or final design elements. Typically created in grayscale, wireframes use simple shapes and placeholders to map out key components like navigation menus, content areas, buttons, and forms.

Importance in the Design Process
Wireframing plays a critical role in the early stages of the design process for several reasons:

Clarifies Structure and Functionality: Wireframes help designers, developers, and stakeholders understand how a product will work before diving into detailed design and development.

Improves User Experience (UX): By focusing on layout and usability, wireframes allow teams to identify and resolve potential UX issues early on.

Facilitates Collaboration and Feedback: Wireframes act as a communication tool among team members and clients, enabling clear discussions about layout and user flow.

Saves Time and Resources: Making changes to a wireframe is far less costly and time-consuming than modifying a fully developed interface.
